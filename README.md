# METABRIC Analysis: Project Overview
Used data visualization, a 3-layer neural network and other classification algorithms to predict breast cancer survival using a METABRIC dataset from Kaggle ([Link](https://www.kaggle.com/kershtheva/starter-breast-cancer-gene-expression-3925d3a5-5)).

Full details on the code can be viewed on my public Kaggle notebook (please click [link](https://www.kaggle.com/kershtheva/starter-breast-cancer-gene-expression-3925d3a5-5)). 

## Resources I used 
**Python Version**: 3.8.3 <br>
**Kaggle Database**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/raghadalharbi/breast-cancer-gene-expression-profiles-metabric) <br>
**ML Packages**: [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [Keras](https://keras.io/) <br>
**Literature**: [Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-beginners-guide-to-xgboost-87f5d4c30ed7), [Keras](https://machinelearningmastery.com/tutorial-first-neural-network-python-keras/)

## Data Cleaning

The following columns were dropped for the model building because they were either patient identifiers or was not expected to be useful in this first iteration: 
- Patient ID
- Cancer type
- Cancer_type_detailed
- Cohort 

The following columns were converted into binary columns with 1 or 0: 
- ER status (measured by IHC) 
- Type of breast surgery 
- HER2 status
- Inferred menopausal states
- Primary tumor laterality
- PR status
- ER status

The following columns were converted into dummy columns 
- Cellularity
- PAM50 + Claudin-low subtype
- Neoplasm histological grade
- Tumor (other histologic subtype) 
- Integrative cluster
- Oncotree code
- HER2 status (measured by snp6)

Undefined and null values were removed.

**Figure 1. Features that have the strongest correlation to death by breast cancer.** A list of the features with the strongest correlation to a survival value of "0" in the METABRIC breast cancer dataset. Factor names are listed on the left and the Pearson correlation coefficient to death is listed on the right. Highest correlations are with patient ID, overall survival (in months), age at diagnosis, tumor size and mutation count.

**Figure 2. Overall survival compared to the number of positive lymph nodes.** Boxplot comparing the overall survival (in months) to the number of lymph nodes containing cancer cells. After 10 positively examined lymph nodes, there are almost no cases of surviving cancer, with the exception of some patients with 15 positively examined lymph nodes. Those who died almost always had less than 100 months to live from the start of the study to their death. In comparison, patients who survived would survive for approximately 50 months longer, on average.
